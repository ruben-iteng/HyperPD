# Template

This is a template project for new faebryk projects. It contains a basic structure and some examples/templates to get you started.

## Getting started
First press `Use this template` button on the top of the page. 
Then clone your new repo locally:
```bash
git clone <your repo>
cd <your repo>
```

### Fill in the templates
replace `{}` and `<>` placeholders and fill in TODOs in following files:
- [README.md](README.md) (this file)
- [pyproject.toml](pyproject.toml)
- remove this header in this file (up until the first "TEMPLATE README START")

### Setup your environment

Make sure you have python3.11 installed
```bash
python --version
```

If you can't upgrade to python3.11, you will first need to make sure to have a working venv with python3.11 installed in it. This process will differ per OS.

Make sure you have poetry installed
```bash
poetry --version
```

#### Option 1: Static faebryk
```bash
# inside your repo dir

#optional: pick alternative faebryk version, see poetry doc for more options
poetry add git+https://github.com/faebryk/faebryk.git#<branch>

poetry install
poetry shell # This activates the new venv
```

#### Option 2: Editable faebryk
```bash
# inside your repo dir
./scripts/setup_local_faebryk.sh [branch]
poetry shell
```

#### Test if it works
```bash
python src/<project_name>/main.py
```
